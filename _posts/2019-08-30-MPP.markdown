### Problem:
A typical concurrency bug: a missing or out-of-order communication can cause protocol violations, deadlocks, or livelocks.

### Solution:
> Step 1: enforcing protocols at compile-time
- Effpi and lambda^pi-calculus: build upon a concurrent functional calculus for channel-based interaction
    - Behavioural types
    - dependent function types

> Step 2: verification of safety/liveness properties
- Type-Level Model Checking
    - Compose types/protocols and decide whether they enjoy safety/liveness properties
    - Transfer behavioural properties of types to programs

#### Examples (A ping-pong system)

### Formal semantics (TBD)

### Evaluations
- Performance vs. size
- Memory vs. size
